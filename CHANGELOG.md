# Changelog

## Release 1.0.1 (2024-12-19) - Maintenance Release

This maintenance release for the Sidecartridge firmware v1.0.1 includes bug fixes and improvements to enhance the overall stability and performance of the firmware.

### Changes
- **Config Flash parameters expanded to 8KB**: The Config Flash parameters have been expanded to 8KB to accommodate additional features and configurations in future releases. This change is transparent to users.

### New features
- **"What's new" screen now displays the latest added Floppy images in the Public Floppy Database:** In the Configurator, in the "Download from the Floppy Images database" section you can see the latest added floppy images. Press the "_" (underscore) key to see the latest added images. It's the default behavior when you enter the Floppy Images database.
- **Y2K patches for the RTC module:** The user now can select if the RTC module will be Y2K compliant or not. This is a new option in the Configurator menus under the RTC and GEMDRIVE section. The default value is Y2K compliant. This option is ignored when a EmuTOS TOS is used, as EmuTOS is Y2K compliant by default.

### Fixes
- **Issue #142:** Fixed misleading information when copying files in TOS 2.06 with GEMDRIVE.
- **Issue #144:** RTC module now correctly works for all TOS versions, including EmuTOS.
- Other minor bug fixes and improvements to enhance the overall stability and performance of the firmware.

### Known issues
- **Issue #143#**: STOS error when loading .bas files when GEMDRIVE is active.

## BETA 0.0.18b (2024-09-25) - SDSC Card Support Re-enabled

This release is a hotfix for version 0.0.18, bringing back support for SDSC cards. These cards were inadvertently disabled in the previous version due to an upgrade of the `no-OS-FatFS-SD-SDIO-SPI-RPi-Pico` library to version 2.6.0. In this release, the library has been reverted to version 1.2.4 to restore SDSC compatibility.

The upcoming v1.0.0 release will also remain pinned to version 1.2.4 to ensure SDSC support. However, **starting from v2.x.x, we will officially drop SDSC support and upgrade the library to version 2.6.0 or higher.**

## BETA 0.0.18 (2024-09-13) - Multi-floppy support and web management

This version will be the last Beta before the final v1.0.0 release. This version has major changes and improvements, specially in the Floppy Emulation mode. It has been tested throughly, but please report any issues you find. We can consider this version as a Release Candidate, so only minor changes to the codebase will be made before the final v1.0.0 release.

### Changes
